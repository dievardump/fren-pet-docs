# Player Vs Player (PVP)

## Battles

Every 30 minutes you can battle a pet that hasn't been bonked for 1 hour.

The odds on the outcome of the battle depend on your attack and defense points vs the other player you are battling so pick your battles wisely.

The winner can get up to 0.5% of the loser's points, which directly affects ETH rewards.

Here's how it works:

1. If you have fewer than 20,000 points:
   - When you attack another player's pet, you can win up to 100 points.
   - If the other pet doesn't have enough points for you to win 100 points, you only win what they can afford to lose.

2. If you have more than 20,000 points:
   - If you attack and win against a pet with fewer points than you, you can only win as many points as they could afford to lose.
   - If you attack and win against a pet with more points than you, you can only win as many points as you could afford to lose.

3. If you attack and lose:
   - If you have fewer points than the pet you attacked, you lose 0.5% of your points.
   - If you have more points than the pet you attacked, there's a formula to figure out how many points you lose. For example, if you attack a pet that could lose 150 points, with a 70% chance of winning, you could lose up to 255 points. However, there's a limit of 0.5% of your total points. So if you could only lose 200 points, you'd only lose 200, not 255. This is to prevent stronger players from bullying weaker ones.


## Defense and Attack Score

Every pet starts with 10 AP (Attack Points) and 10 DP (Defense Points).

Every time you level up 1 level by upgrading your pet you get to spin a gatcha machine that will reward you with APs or DPs.

Here is the formula to decide your win probability: `(Attacker’s AP) / (Attacker’s AP + Defender’s DP)`

## Kills

When a pet's TOD (Time Of Death) reaches 0 you can kill it, burn the NFT onchain and earn a star, and stars are very hard to come by.

You can check how many stars you've gained on the my pet tab.
