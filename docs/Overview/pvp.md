# Player Vs Player (PVP)

## Battles

Every 30 minutes you can battle a pet that is above your level and that hasn't been bonked for 1 hour.

The odds on the outcome of the battle depend on your attack and defense points vs the other player you are battling so pick your battles wisely.

The winner can get up to 0.5% of the loser's points, which directly affects ETH rewards.

### Up to 0.5%

The bonk system has been modified to be fairer to everyone. Most of the time, you can only win what you can lose (exception for low level pets).

- if you have less than 20 000 points (potential loss < 100 points):
	- you can win up to 100 points by attacking other players. If that pet's points don't allow you to win 100 points, you only win what that pet can lose.
- if you have more than 20 000 points:
	- if you attack a pet and you win:
		- if that pet has less points than you, you can only win as many points as they can lose
		- if that pet has more points than you, you can only win as many points as you can lose
	- if you attack a pet and you lose:
		- if you have less points than that pet, you lose 0.5% of your points 
		- if you **are stronger** than that pet, with more points, there is a formula involved to calculate your loss. **Example**: If you attack a pet than can lose 150 points, with 70% chance of winning, you can lose `150 + (150 * 70%) = 255 points`. With always the limit of 0.5% of your points: if you can only lose 200 points, you will only lose 200 and not 255. This is to limit bullying of weaker pets.


## Defense and Attack Score

Every pet starts with 10 AP (Attack Points) and 10 DP (Defense Points).

Every time you level up 1 level by upgrading your pet you get to spin a gatcha machine that will reward you with APs or DPs.

Here is the formula to decide your win probability: `(Attacker’s AP) / (Attacker’s AP + Defender’s DP)`

## Kills

When a pet's TOD (Time Of Death) reaches 0 you can kill it, burn the NFT onchain and earn a star, and stars are very hard to come by.

You can check how many stars you've gained on the my pet tab.
